    The time complexity of this algorithm is O(N^2) which measn that it doubles every 
call.
    
    The algorithm's performance was good on my laptop. To run the three studies took a 
total of 1 minute and was extremely efficient when compared to the recursive call. This algorithm is able to positively impact science by quickly analyzing new DNA sequences or viruses after discovery. Just today, Feb 6th, 2020, it was just reported that a researcher in Germany discovered the first offspring of two different humanoid subspecies.
